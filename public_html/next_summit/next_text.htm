<p><strong><u>Interview with Dr. Patricia Edgar </u></strong><strong><u>Chair World Summit on Media for Children Foundation </u></strong></p>
<p><br />
  <em>1 What is  the background to the World Summit on Media for Children?</em><br />
  The Summit Movement has a 16 year history starting with the  first World Summit on Television and Children held in Melbourne, Australia, in  March 1995 which I hosted as Director of the Australian Children&rsquo;s Television  Foundation. &nbsp;670 people from 72 countries came together to discuss the  changing environment for children's television programming. Subsequently  Summits have been held every three years. The 2nd World Summit was held in  London, England, in 1998; the 3rd World Summit in Thessaloniki, Greece, in  2001, the Fourth World Summit on Media for Children in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  during 2004 (with more than 3000 in attendance). Johannesburg hosted a Summit  in 2007 and we have recently held Summit 2010 in Karlstad.<br />
  The Summits act as a catalyst for action.&nbsp; Both officially and informally, the Summits  provide an intense, exciting and fertile environment for collaboration and the  exchange of ideas and information. Thousands of people have gathered in  inspirational meetings to share experiences. &nbsp;<br />
  In addition to the many accomplishments  of individual Summits, collectively they result in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advocacy for and the  establishment of national policies which prioritise and promote the development  and provision of high-quality educational digital media for children;</li>
  <li>Greater understanding of the  challenges and opportunities presented by an increasingly competitive media  world &ndash; from both supply and demand perspectives;</li>
  <li>The development of world class  training programmes for the producers and creators of educational media for  children;</li>
  <li>The creation of digital media  initiatives which present indigenous stories to a global audience; </li>
  <li>The development of research  networks across the globe which examine the role of media in children&rsquo;s  development; and</li>
  <li>Greater collaboration and  cooperation between local and global governments, organisations and individuals  committed to the provision of digital media which meet the educational needs of  children and young people.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2. Who are  the target groups for the Summits?</em><br />
Summits cast the net widely, bringing  together key local and global players in the development, creation,  distribution and regulation of media on all platforms for children and young  people. They are also attended by government representatives, NGOs, educators ,  researchers&nbsp; and business people. </p>
<p><br />
  <em>3. Why have  you invited Asia and the ABU to host this 2014 Summit ? </em><br />
  You will see from the range  of countries where Summits have already been held that we have not yet held a  World Summit in Asia, although there was a regional meeting in Manila in 1996  which attracted considerable support. Board Members are very enthusiastic about  this potential collaboration with ABU and RTM Malaysia. Over the years I have  had an association, in various roles, with ABU and I am aware of the wealth of  experience, the wide networks and diverse viewpoints you bring collectively.<br />
2014 marks the 50th  anniversary of the ABU. That significant occasion will bring added value to the  WSMC. With more than 215 members the ABU is one of the most important Regional  Broadcasting Unions in the world. By 2014 I understand your membership may  reach more than 300 members. That means potentially you can reach an audience  of 4 billion. You have more children living in your region than anywhere else  in the world. That is why this Summit will be a timely and very important international  event.</p>
<p><br />
  4. <em>What do you  wish the WSMC to achieve? </em><br />
  When the Summit movement began 15 years ago our aim was to  protect and promote quality children&rsquo;s television programs. Technologically we  have travelled well beyond our first objectives. This  is a time when broadcasters are facing the challenge of convergence with  diverse digital technologies. The resulting highly competitive marketplace is  changing the assumptions which have long underpinned broadcasting systems and  their content development. Globalization has led to a focus on the international  marketplace rather than local child audiences. &nbsp;Media are a potent educational force in  children&rsquo;s lives, but the industry can be slow to respond to the educational  challenges and opportunities media offer.<br />
  Given access, most children and young people embrace media  technology. This is a gift to the children&rsquo;s entertainment industry, but the  content we are producing struggles to innovate, is heavily commercialized and  often irrelevant to the needs and interests of many 21st century  children.<br />
  The Summit needs to ask some fundamental  questions: &lsquo;How did we get where we are today? How did we change our focus from  one of commitment to children&rsquo;s development? How did we shift from a healthy,  vibrant creative industry, to an industry struggling to survive and overwhelmed  by global economics? Why are some critics calling our work damaging and harmful  to children?&rsquo; &nbsp;It is time to revisit our  values and perhaps create entirely new ones, given what we know now.<br />
  &nbsp;The  2014 World Summit will be a great place for industry and policy leaders to  gather and have that discussion; to help revitalise the industry, find new  creative and economic models so we can be as beneficial to all children around  the world as we aspire to be. We need to learn from the past and build on the  best. &nbsp;And where better to have that  discussion than Asia?<br />
Innovation in education and in media production is  fundamental to progress, to economic stability and global peace &ndash; and media&rsquo;s  role is central.&nbsp; The World Summit Foundation is ambitious in wanting to  be effective in leading the policy, research and production debate to encourage  the development of a new 21st Century global vision for children&rsquo;s  media and education.</p>
